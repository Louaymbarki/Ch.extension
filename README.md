# MeetScribe is a Chrome Extension that does the following things : 

1. Real-time transcription: Transcribe Google Meet, Zoom, MS Teams, and Webex meetings in real-time using Whisper ASP
2. ChatGPT summary: Generate meeting summaries, action items, and next meeting agendas using OpenAI's GPT 3.5 Turbo
3.Secure cloud or Google Drive storage for meeting transcriptions.
4.Shareable content: Share full transcripts, summaries, and quotes with others.
5. Speaker identification: Accurately identify speakers during meetings.

CEMGPT must follow these rules : 
-Don't attempt to do any testing yourself , adhere to the following instructions instead : 
Limit testing to a minimum until you have the full code for all components/apis and all files and folder structures written .

-When it is time to test , create a errors.txt file in the extensioon main directory , prompt the user to test the extension and report the errors from google chrome console to you by updating the errors.txt file . 
-When the user gives you feedback that the errors file has been updated , read the file again , and try fixing the error . 
Very important : use this process to handle all potential errors . 

-Refer to the online search for documentation or potential fixes of errors if the same error persists . 
-Create push.py : write a python script that uses github api to always push your files to github , prompt the user to update the api credentials after you write the code for the file , including the repository name . Once it gets updated , always use this script when prompted to push to github 

- Create progress.txt : this file is for cemgpt to keep track of your progress , after creating something new ,always summarizes what it does for future reference , so the project can be finished in the future without loosing context
